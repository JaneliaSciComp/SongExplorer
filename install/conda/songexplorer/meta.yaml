  summary: deep learning for acoustic signals
  description: |
    You have an audio recording, and you want to know where certain classes of
    sounds are.  SongExplorer is trained to recognize such words by manually
    giving it a few examples.  It will then automatically calculate the
    probability, over time, of when those words occur in all of your recordings.
    Alternatively, you have two or more sets of audio recordings, and you want
    to know if there are differences between them.  SongExplorer can
    automatically detect sounds in those recordings and cluster them based on
    how well it can distinguish between them.  Applications suitable for
    SongExplorer include quantifying the rate or pattern of words emitted by a
    particular species, distinguishing a recording of one species from another,
    and discerning whether individuals of the same species produce different
    song.  Underneath the hood is a deep convolutional neural network.  The
    input is the raw audio stream, and the output is a set of mutually-exclusive
    probability waveforms corresponding to each word of interest.
